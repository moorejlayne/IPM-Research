The files in this repository are the R code and data used to conduct the analysis contained in three separate papers, listed below. Overall, the work is focused on using integral projection models (IPMs) to understand marine population dynamics, with a specific eye toward conservation efforts. 

IPM-Base: This analysis builds an age- and size-structured IPM to describe a single population of Crassostrea gigas oysters in the Pacific NW.

IPM-Feedbacks: This analysis extends the IPM developed in IPM-Base to include a positive feedback between adult oysters and oyster larvae, using data from a population of Crassostrea virginia oysters in North Carolina.

IPM-Stochastic: This analysis develops some new methods to understand stochastic, open populations, and applies the results to a population of giant clams and a population of corals.
